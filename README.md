CalorieWise is a simple and lightweight app to monitor calories and keep track of them, no internet or anything needed.

I really just wanted somewhere to keep track of my calories and whatever but after seeing all the ad ridden stuff on the play store i just decided to make my own, nothing out of the ordinary but i can garatee you that it does the work and there's no bloat.
 
 
The app has 3 components, the app itself that counts your calories in the day and depending on how much you got it the total will change color. It has also some tips for reminding people of how many calories daily stuff has because i've seen quite a lot of people get really confused with it.

And the most important part is seeing your progress of course, you cant change without checking what went wrong. It saves the calories of each day for the month you're in and when a new month arrives it wipes it and the loop continues.
